## Summary

Gold Tone is a company that has several very different brands under their umbrella. Originally, they had separate websites for each one, but were unhappy with the lack of cross-promotion and brand awareness. I designed and built one website for all the brands, allowing customers to explore the different brands (including adding products from any brand to the same cart). They then saw a substantial increase in sales and leads for their lesser known brands.

## My Role

I was brought on at Gold Tone Music Group as their technical developer, responsible for building and maintaining their websites (full-stack), as well as overseeing software/app development.

## Problem

They wanted to increase cross-promotion and brand awareness between the customers of the different brand sites, as they were missing leads due to the separate sites.

## Solution

I built one website that encompassed all of the brands, so customers could explore the different brands, switch between them, as well as add a mix of products to purchase all at once.

## Results

They saw an enormous boost in sales and leads on all sites, especially in their smaller/newer brands.

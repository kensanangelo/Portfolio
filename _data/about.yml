   title: I’m Ken San Angelo, a web developer.
   summary:
      - I am currently working as a technical developer at Big Vision, which allows me to constantly challenge myself and improve my skills. I’m not currently accepting freelance work, but I am always open to meeting new people so feel free to get in touch.

      - I am a graduate of the Web Design program at the University of Central Florida. While there, I was included in the School of Visual Arts and Design Premiere and Exhibition 2 years in a row for web-based projects that I worked on. I am also a founder of Design+Code@UCF, the web design and development club at UCF.

      - Besides web development, I also have a passion for photography and videography, which you can check out at <a href="https://sanangelophoto.com/">sanangelophoto.com</a>.
